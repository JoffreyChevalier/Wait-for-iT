# Getting started

### To launch the project, use this command in your terminal :

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

You need to use ```--build ``` only if you add a new package or if you modify a file outside **"src"** directory (*ex :
add a theme in tailwind.config file*).

### else, you just have to run

```sh
docker compose up
```

Client run on http://localhost:3000/
